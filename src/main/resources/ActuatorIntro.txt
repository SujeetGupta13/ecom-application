Provides built in production-ready features to monitor and manage your app. like health, matrix, info etc.
Faetures:
 Built-in endpoints
 Ability to view realtime metrics, Dashboard -> hostname/metric. tells CPU usage, no of DB connections ect.
 customizable -> we can add new endpoints, customize existing endpoints, who can control the endpoints like who can access.

http://localhost:8080/actuator/health -> returns {"status":"UP"}
If we want to get more info like disk space usage, DB status of DB used in app, then we can get that info by adding some config like below. Actuator gets which DB to check from pom.xml
 management.endpoint.health.show-details: ALWAYS

By default /info endpoint return empty object.

http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics --> This will give all the enndpoints name to be used with http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/{requiredMetricName}.
Metrics end points give info about Disk space, hikari connection, jdbc connection, JVM info, threads, system cpu count/usgae, process cpu count/usage, tomcat sessions. etc.

http://localhost:8080/actuator/loggers - > This will give log levels applied to diff package level in the application as well as library used in the app.
http://localhost:8080/actuator/loggers/{pkgname} - detailed info for that pkg.

log level can be set to thse levels for a pkg:
"levels": [
    "OFF",
    "ERROR",
    "WARN",
    "INFO",
    "DEBUG",
    "TRACE"
  ]
We can dynamically change the log level of the app or at pkg level without restarting application. used to find the root cause of app without restarting.
Send a POST req :http://localhost:8080/actuator/loggers/com.app.ecom with body :{"configuredLevel": "DEBUG"}

http://localhost:8080/actuator/beans -> list all beans available in application context with beans alias name,type of bean, scope like Singleton and dependent on which other beans.
ex: "cartController":{"aliases":[],"scope":"singleton","type":"com.app.ecom.controller.CartController","resource":"file [D:\\EmbarkX\\ecom-application\\target\\classes\\com\\app\\ecom\\controller\\CartController.class]","dependencies":["cartService"]}
### This endpoint exposes the internal str of the application, not recommended in prod.######
